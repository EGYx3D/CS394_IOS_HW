============

IOS App HW

HW1_BlackJack is a bad folder, scrap that. Final game is in BlackJack_HW1. 

Took forever to understand and fix problem with git, then code was very difficult and was not working at all so I looked at tutorials and added a few of my own functions like the double, revealWinner and ADVICE button. 

No time to impliment bet tonight so I'll work on that and customize card images later this week, hopefully tomorrow.
